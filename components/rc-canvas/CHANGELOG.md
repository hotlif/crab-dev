## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`d11001f`](https://github.com/hotlif/crab-dev/commit/d11001fa35d4af4f53d0571c074de4b3e9806903) Thanks [@hotlif](https://github.com/hotlif)! - Rebuild the component library around a single package inventory, independent architecture and usage classifications, and three design systems: MD3 Expressive (md3), Apple (apple), and shadcn/ui (shadcn).
  
  This is a breaking pre-1.0 migration: unify controlled/uncontrolled values, selection callbacks, component APIs, sizes, and density contracts; replace legacy theme identifiers and remove old API aliases. Only stored browser appearance preferences are migrated automatically.
  
  Declare required React/ReactDOM ^19.2.0 peers through runtime dependency chains while retaining development dependencies. Correct runtime token dependencies, public/internal exports, strict declaration consumption, and independent offline PnP package verification.
  
  Correct RTL layout and overlay placement, field validation placement, embedded editor composition and focus, native virtual-scroll synchronization, and composed button feedback. Define independent multiline field geometry and preserve all eight configuration axes across controlled previews and PDF Web Components. Built-in error messages follow locale without replacing application-owned error data.
  
  Restore compiled focus and disabled styles by using valid CSS template comments, keep Tree focus indicators inside measured containers and above selected row backgrounds, accommodate localized color-channel labels, preserve physical Table column geometry with RTL content, and accept PDF byte sources from iframe realms without treating them as URLs. Respect reduced motion in the property-driven Canvas animation example and let the pill Tabs example inherit the configured size.
  
  Follow .website/docs/guides/migration.mdx before upgrading. All affected packages remain experimental; minor bumps represent the coordinated pre-1.0 breaking release and do not declare a stable 1.0 contract.

### Patch Changes

- [`ec1f759`](https://github.com/hotlif/crab-dev/commit/ec1f759d51a83a456b4eb7f608f2e4908d4d46da) Thanks [@hotlif](https://github.com/hotlif)! - 统一组件内部的组合树父元素查找，保留实际 slot、普通父元素与跨文档 Shadow host。修复 iframe 内 Shadow 画布遗漏最近主题祖先、主题切换后未重绘的问题，复用相同工具保护浮层焦点恢复；新增保留显式 DPR、草稿与图元坐标的公开示例和真实像素回归场景。

- [`ec1f759`](https://github.com/hotlif/crab-dev/commit/ec1f759d51a83a456b4eb7f608f2e4908d4d46da) Thanks [@hotlif](https://github.com/hotlif)! - Keep fixed-size Canvas bitmaps in sync with real browser zoom and display resolution changes. A shared internal hook observes the owning document's window, rearms resolution queries and releases listeners; explicit dpr continues to take priority. Drawing coordinates and component sizes remain independent of raster resolution.
  
  Keep the internal observation flag optional and explicitly typed in published declarations. The strict independent PnP consumer checks omitted, boolean and invalid string arguments against the packed entrypoint.

- [`ec1f759`](https://github.com/hotlif/crab-dev/commit/ec1f759d51a83a456b4eb7f608f2e4908d4d46da) Thanks [@hotlif](https://github.com/hotlif)! - Render bitmap and SDF text through the owning document's 2D canvas when a browser
  does not implement OffscreenCanvas. This fixes Canvas text and dependent charts
  failing to mount in WebKit environments without that API. Worker rendering keeps
  its OffscreenCanvas path; glyph geometry and texture formats stay unchanged.

- [`ec1f759`](https://github.com/hotlif/crab-dev/commit/ec1f759d51a83a456b4eb7f608f2e4908d4d46da) Thanks [@hotlif](https://github.com/hotlif)! - Use high precision for world and projection geometry in vertex shaders. WebKit's mediump implementation overflows the squared length of line spans from 256px, collapsing long chart grid and reference lines while reporting no GL error. Keep public coordinates and fragment colors unchanged, and add real GPU pixel regression across the boundary.

- [`d11001f`](https://github.com/hotlif/crab-dev/commit/d11001fa35d4af4f53d0571c074de4b3e9806903) Thanks [@hotlif](https://github.com/hotlif)! - Keep PDF thumbnail focus outlines inside the virtual column without changing its row geometry, including selected pages and RTL. Share outline width and offset with the row's reserved space.
  
  Use theme-aware semantic text and edge colors in Canvas and FlowDiagram examples. Start the Transformer example with all shapes visible and retain viewport changes while selecting and transforming shapes.
